# UM-Bridge

[![Build Status](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/UMBridge.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/UMBridge.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is a julia UM-Bridge client. UM-Bridge (the UQ and Model Bridge) provides a unified interface for numerical models that is accessible from virtually any programming language or framework. It is primarily intended for coupling advanced models (e.g. simulations of complex physical processes) to advanced statistical or optimization methods.

The project documentation including a model and benchmark library can be found here: [Documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).

Documentation for the julia client can be found here: [Julia client](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/umbridge/clients.html)
